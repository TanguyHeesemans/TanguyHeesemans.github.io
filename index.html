<h1>Tanguy Heesemans</h1>
<p>Master's student Molecular Life Sciences at Wageningen University. Interested in plant mechanobiology and applying physical concepts to biological systems.</p>

  <p>I have just started my thesis in the  
    <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/agrotechnology-and-food-sciences/biomolecular-sciences/laboratory-of-biochemistry/research/green-mechanobiology.htm" target="_blank">Green Mechanobiology</a>
    group of Joris Sprakel. Together with him and my 
    supervisor Cecilia Borassi we will investigate the 
    molecular mechanisms underlying plant's perception of touch. </p>
